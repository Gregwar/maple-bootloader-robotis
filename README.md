# Maple Bootloader for Robotis boards

This is an adaptation of the maple bootloader in order to make it work with the
Robotis CM900 and OpenCM9.04 boards:

* [Robotis CM900](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/auxdevice/controller/cm-900_manual.htm)
* [Robotis OpenCM9.04](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/auxdevice/controller/opencm9.04.htm)

snapshot of the bootloader in `snapshot/maple-boot-cm900.bin`.
